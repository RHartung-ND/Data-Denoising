# Data-Denoising

## Part 1: Project Overview

This project aims to build a neural network for removing high-frequency noise from audio files. The core concept involves training a self-supervised autoencoder. The autoencoder will learn to encode and then decode the input audio signal.

The project will follow a standard machine learning workflow, including data acquisition, preprocessing, model development, training, validation, and testing. A crucial aspect will be creating a robust and versatile model.

## Part 2: Proposed Solution

The proposed solution involves training a neural network to learn a mapping from noisy audio to clean audio. An autoencoder architecture is well-suited for this task. The noisy audio will be fed as input to the encoder, which will learn to compress the information into a lower-dimensional latent representation. The decoder will then take this latent representation and attempt to reconstruct the original, clean audio.

The key idea is that the network, in its attempt to reconstruct the input, will prioritize learning the dominant, meaningful features of the audio signal. High-frequency noise, being less structured and less correlated with the underlying signal, will be harder for the network to reproduce accurately. Consequently, the output of the decoder will be closer to the clean signal, effectively denoising the input.

Several neural network architectures can be explored for the encoder and decoder, including Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), or a hybrid approach. CNNs are effective at capturing local patterns in the audio signal, while RNNs are good at modeling temporal dependencies. The choice of architecture will depend on experimentation and analysis of the audio data.

## Part 3: Dataset Acquisition and Preparation

A crucial part of this project is acquiring a suitable dataset. Ideally, the dataset should consist of pairs of clean audio and corresponding noisy audio. Since obtaining perfectly paired data can be challenging, a practical approach is to start with a dataset of clean audio recordings and then synthetically add high-frequency noise to create the noisy counterparts.

### Data Sources:

1. **Clean Audio:**  Publicly available audio datasets will be explored. Potential sources include:
    * **FreeSound:** A large repository of Creative Commons licensed audio clips.
    * **LibriSpeech:** A corpus of English speech read aloud.
    * **UrbanSound8K:** A dataset of urban sounds.

2. **Noise:** High-frequency noise can be generated synthetically. Different types of noise can be considered, such as white noise, pink noise, or recordings of real-world high-frequency interference. The characteristics of the added noise (frequency range, amplitude) will be varied to create a more robust model.

### Dataset Split:

The dataset will be divided into three subsets:

1. **Training Set (70%):**  Used to train the neural network's parameters.
2. **Validation Set (15%):**  Used to monitor the model's performance during training and tune hyperparameters. This helps prevent overfitting to the training data.
3. **Test Set (15%):**  A held-out set used for final evaluation of the trained model's performance on unseen data. This set will only be used after the model is fully trained and validated.

### Data Preprocessing:

1. **Audio Representation:** The audio signals will be converted into a suitable representation for neural networks. Common techniques include:
    * **Waveform:** Directly using the raw audio samples.
    * **Spectrogram:** Representing the audio as a time-frequency image. This can be generated using Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT). Spectrograms are often more suitable for CNNs.
    * **Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs):**  Features that are perceptually relevant to human hearing.

2. **Normalization:** The audio data will be normalized to a standard range (e.g., between 0 and 1) to improve the training process.

3. **Noise Addition:** High-frequency noise will be added to the clean audio signals in the training and validation sets. The noise level will be varied to create a more robust model.

## Part 4: Evaluation Metrics

The performance of the denoising model will be evaluated using several metrics:

1. **Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR):**  Measures the ratio of the desired signal power to the noise power. A higher SNR indicates better denoising performance.
2. **Mean Squared Error (MSE):**  Measures the average squared difference between the clean audio and the denoised audio. A lower MSE indicates better performance.
3. **Perceptual Evaluation of Audio Quality (PEAQ):**  A more sophisticated metric that takes into account human perception of audio quality.

## Part 5: Tools and Technologies

* **Programming Language:** Python
* **Deep Learning Framework:** TensorFlow or PyTorch
* **Audio Processing Libraries:** Librosa, PyDub
* **Data Visualization:** Matplotlib, Seaborn


## Part 6: Generative AI Disclosure

I did use Google Gemini to explore different high-level solutions, suggesting potential datasets, and outlining the project timeline. Specifically, Gemini contributed to the initial brainstorming of the autoencoder approach, the suggestion of using spectrograms and MFCCs for audio representation, and the outline of the data preprocessing steps. The generated text was used as inspiration and then re-written and expanded upon to create this document. The core ideas and the final structure of the project are my own.
